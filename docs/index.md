# Plone Sphinx Theme

[Plone Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/plone/plone-sphinx-theme) is the official Sphinx theme for [documentation of Plone 6](https://6.docs.plone.org/), [Plone Conference trainings](https://training.plone.org/), and documentation of various Plone packages.

It uses [Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a rich and extensible flavor of Markdown for authoring documentation that combines the simplicity of CommonMark with the features of reStructuredText.

Plone Sphinx Theme requires Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12.
